## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light pale green (#e5f5f2), near the primary color in hue, but much lighter and desaturated, so it will not clash or distract.
- Accent color: A contrasting peach (#f28c8c), chosen for visibility on top of both primary and background colors, for calls to action, important notifications, etc.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and short descriptive text, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for longer text descriptions.
- Use simple, modern icons for categories and navigation.
- Prioritize a clean and intuitive layout for effortless expense tracking and financial overview.
- Subtle animations will show transactions being added and confirmed.
